Finally, make sure to enable gizmos in your scene so that you can see the shapes as you
are working with them.

-- Setting up the Scene --
1) Navigate to ShadowGen > Prefabs.
2) In your scene replace the Main Camera with the Main Camera prefab.
3) Add the Shadow and Shadow Manager prefabs to your scene. 
4) Add PointLight, Circle, Rectangle, and CompleShape to your scene in order to build it out

-- Using the Shapes and Lights --

		rectangle and Y adjusts the height of the rectangle.
